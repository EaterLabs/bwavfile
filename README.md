# bwavfile
Rust Wave File Reader/Writer with Broadcast-WAV, MBWF and RF64 Support

This is currently a work-in-progress!

## Use

```rust

 use bwavfile::WaveReader;
 let mut r = WaveReader::open("tests/media/ff_silence.wav").unwrap();
 
 let format = r.format().unwrap();
 assert_eq!(format.sample_rate, 44100);
 assert_eq!(format.channel_count, 1);
 
 let mut frame_reader = r.audio_frame_reader().unwrap();
 let mut buffer = frame_reader.create_frame_buffer();
 
 let read = frame_reader.read_integer_frame(&mut buffer).unwrap();
 
 assert_eq!(buffer, [0i32]);
 assert_eq!(read, 1);
```

## Note on Testing

All of the media for the integration tests is committed to the respository
in zipped form. Before you can run tests, you need to `cd` into the `tests` 
directory and run the `create_test_media.sh` script. Note that one of the 
test files (the RF64 test case) is over four gigs in size.
